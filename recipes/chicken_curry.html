    <h2>Why did I choose Chicken Curry as the Dish for this Exercise?</h2>
    <P>
        is what I had for dinner prior to doing this. a full meal, pack with protein,
        flavor and is done in 1 pot!
    </P>

    <p>
        Also something that I will like to mention in addition,
        at the time I'm writing this paragraph was the second time I tried chicken curry.
        the first time being yesterday at a fancy restaurant.
        My wife was so amazed by the Indian flavors that she beg me to replicate the dish at home the day after.
        Lets continue with the dish ingredients.
